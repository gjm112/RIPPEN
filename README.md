# RIPPEN
**Description**
RIPPEN aims to measure a QBs passing performance and provide a meaningful quantification that can be easily analyzed.  In a simulated world, how well would a QB perform starting from their 20 yard line and only performing pass plays. This pass played will be selected using a Bayesian model, which allows rookies and backups with minimal data to be fairly evaluated. Drives would end in a TD(7pts), FG(3pts), or Turnover(0pts). A playerâ€™s RIPPEN is the average number of points they would be expected to score per drive (or x10 drives a game).
