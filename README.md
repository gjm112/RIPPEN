# RIPPEN
**Description:**
RIPPEN, Rush Independent Passing Player Efficiency Number, is a new measurement of passer performance. In a simulated world, how would a passer perform starting from their twenty yard line and only performing pass plays? The aspects of each play are simulated using a Bayesian model. This allows rookies and backups with minimal data to be fairly evaluated. Drives would end in a touchdown, field goal or turnover. A playerâ€™s RIPPEN is the average number of points they would be expected to score per drive. Our metric improves on existing passer rating systems because it is updated to current NFL data, does not weight passing touchdowns, and it is able to be more intuitively understood.
