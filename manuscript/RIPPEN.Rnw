\begin{abstract}
RIPPEN, Rush Independent Passing Player Efficiency Number, is a new measurement of passer performance. In a simulated world, how would a passer perform starting from their twenty yard line and only performing pass plays? The aspects of each play are simulated using a Bayesian model. This allows rookies and backups with minimal data to be fairly evaluated. Drives would end in a touchdown, field goal or turnover. A playerâ€™s RIPPEN is the average number of points they would be expected to score per drive. Our metric improves on existing passer rating systems because it is updated to current NFL data, does not weight passing touchdowns, and it is able to be more intuitively understood.

\section{Introduction}
The NFL's current passer rating formula has officially been in place since the 1973 season.  This version of the rating was developed by Don Smith, Seymour Siwoff, and Don Weiss. (https://www.profootballhof.com/news/nfl-s-passer-rating/).  The basic idea was to look at four passing categories -- completion percentage, passing yards, touchdowns thrown, and interceptions -- and award a quarterback 1 point for an average performance, 2 points for an elite performance, and 0 for a poor performance(http://www.donsteinberg.com/qbrating.htm).  Their rating across these four components could then be averaged.  Using data from the 1970 NFL season, the average completion percentage, average yards per attempt, average touchdown percentage, and average interception percentage were approximately 50\%, 7, 5\%, and 5.5\%.  

Using these numbers, formulas were derived to map dismal average, and exceptional performaces to approximately 0, 1, and 2, respectively.  For instance, for completion percentage the formula is $\frac{\frac{C}{A}-0.3}{0.2}$, which equals 0, 1, and 2 for a completion percentages of 30\%, 50\%, and 70\%, respectively.  Formulas for the other three components are defined similarly.  Each of the four components are bounded below by 0 and capped at 2.375 and then added together to get number between 0 and 9.5.  Then, this sum is divided by 6 and multipled by 100.  The reason for this last adjustment was simply, as Don Steinberg explains it, to make the score ``more meaningful":   

\begin{quote}
[Don] Smith thought it would be more meaningful if an excellent score came to around 100, just like in school. "I think our attitude was that 100 was an A," he recalls. "And anything above 100, that was an A-plus." So, in a move that made sense at the time and has had everyone else confused for three decades, he multiplied the raw total by 100 and divided by 6, turning a statistically average performance -- 1s across the board -- into 66.7. It also made the maximum rating a ridiculous 158.2.
(http://www.donsteinberg.com/qbrating.htm)
\end{quote}


All of this leads to the NFL formula for passer rating (http://www.nfl.com/help/quarterbackratingformula).  Using the notation from \cite{vanDohlen2011}:
$$
QBR = \left(\frac{\frac{C}{A}-0.3}{0.2} + \frac{\frac{Y}{A}-3}{4} + \frac{\frac{T}{A}}{0.05} + \frac{0.095-\frac{I}{A}}{0.04}\right)\left(\frac{100}{6}\right)
$$
where 
$C$ = Number of Completions\\
$Y$ = Number of Yards\\
$A$ = Number of Attempts\\
$T$ = Number of Touchdowns\\
$I$ = Number of Interceptions\\

Each of these four components has a maximum of 2.375, so a ``perfect" passer rating in the NFL is $\frac{(2.375)(4)(100)}{6} = 158.3$.  

It should be noted that college football uses a different formula for passer rating.  The NCAA passer rating is [NEED A BETTER CITATION HERE]: 
$$
\frac{8.4Y + 330T + 100C - 200I}{A}
$$
where 
$C$ = Number of Completions\\
$Y$ = Number of Yards\\
$A$ = Number of Attempts\\
$T$ = Number of Touchdowns\\
$I$ = Number of Interceptions\\

In college football, thre are no caps on each of the components, which measn that the college football passer rating can vary from -731.6 to 1261.6. 

In this article, a new metric is proposed to replace passer rating.  The main goals of the proposed measure are to use similar simple inputs as passer rating using only open source data and open source code, provide results on a meaningful scale in meaningful units, and to provide variability estimates of the measure.  

The rest of the article provides a literature review, then a description of the proposed measure, a presentation of results, and then concludes with ideas for future work.  

Passer rating is bad.  RIPPEN is better.  

\section{Passer Rating Alternatives}
In 2011, ESPN introduced a metric, developed by their  stats and information group, called Total Quarterback Rating (Total QBR) (http://www.espn.com/blog/statsinfo/post/\_/id/123701/how-is-total-qbr-calculated-we-explain-our-quarterback-rating).  Total QBR differs from traditional passer rating in many ways, most notably though, the developers sought to include contextual elements into the calculation.  They did this by looking at expected points added (EPA).  The idea of EPA is to look at the difference in expected points before and after a play: if a play resulted in something good for the offense, EPA is positive; if a play was bad for the offense, EPA is negative.  Team-level EPA is computed for each play, and then the total value of EPA is divided among all the players on the field. Finally, there is also an adjustment made for plays that happen in ``garbage time" (as defined by win probability).  Originally, there was a also an adjustment made for plays made in ``clutch situations", but that has been removed from the original formulation.  Total QBR, as of 2016, is now adjusted for strength of opponent.  (https://www.footballoutsiders.com/stats/qb)

\subsection{Criticism of QBR}
Arbitrary scale (0 to 158.3??)
Hard to interpret (What does 121.6 mean?)
QBR overly credits QBs for scoring TDs -- discuss whether or not this is entirely wrong. Something to be said for "getting er done", but they weight this a bit too much for a metric which assesses QB efficacy.



\section{Methods}
The idea of this method is to model the distribution of play outcomes from a certain quarterback.  Once we have a model for the ditribution of play outcomes, drives can be simulated based on this distribution.  One could then look at drive outcomes and rate quarterbacks based on a summary of these simulated outcomes.  We refer to this measure as Rush Independent Passing Player Efficiency Number, or RIPPEN, which is formally defined below.  

Drives are simulated using the following rules: 

\begin{itemize}
\item Drive starts on 20 yard line at 1st and 10.  
\item Simulate if the pass was an interception or not. 
\begin{itemize}
\item Yes: Drive ends.  Return 0. 
\item No: Simulate pass.
\end{itemize}
\item Simulate if the pass was complete.  
\begin{itemize}
\item Yes: Simulate yards.
\item No: 0 yards. Update down.
\end{itemize}
\item Simulate Yards
\begin{itemize}
\item Update down and distance to go.  
\end{itemize}
\item This gets repeated until we reach an ending state.
\begin{itemize}
\item Interception: return 0.  
\item Reach 4th down: return 3 with probability a function of the yardage left, 0 otherwise.  
\item Touchdown: return 7. 
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Let the random variables $D_j$ be the value of simulated drive $j$.  $D_j$ takes on values of either 0, 3, or 7, and $\bar{D} = \frac{\sum_j^{n_{s}}D_j}{n_{s}}$ where $n_s$ is the number of simulated drived.  We then define our measure as follows: 

$$
RIPPEN = 10 \bar{D}
$$
.

This can then be interpreted as the average number of points a team would score in ten possessions if their play outcomes were entirely based upon the performance of the quarterback's passing plays.  

\section{Model}
\subsection{Completions}
For a given quarterback over a given period of time, let $n_{comp}$ and $n_{att}$ be the number of completed passes and the number of attempted passes, respectively.  We then have the following Bayesian model for completion percentage: 

$$
n_{comp} \sim Binomial(n_{att}, p_{comp})
$$
with the following prior
$$
p_{comp} \sim \beta(\alpha_c,\beta_c)
$$.

This yields the following posterior distribution for $p_{comp}$: 
$$
p_{comp} |n_{comp}, n_{att} \sim Beta(\alpha_c + n_{comp}, \beta_c +n_{att}-n_{comp})
$$.  

\subsection{Interceptions}
Similarly, for a given quarterback over a given period of time, let $n_{int}$ and $n_{inc}$ be the number of intercepted passes and the number of incomplete passes (interceptions are considered incomplete passes), respectively.  We then have the following Bayesian model for interception percentage given an incomplete pass: 

$$
n_{int} \sim Binomial(n_{inc}, p_{int})
$$
with the following prior
$$
p_{int} \sim Beta(\alpha_i,\beta_i)
$$.
This yields the following posterior distribution for $p_{int}$: 
$$
p_{int} |n_{int},n_{inc} \sim Beta(\alpha_i + n_{int}, \beta_i +n_{inc} - n_i)
$$.  
It is important to note that $p_{int}$ is estimating the probability of an interception given that the pass was incomplete, not the interception rate across all attempted passes.  

In all simulations, we chose to use non-informative priors and set all hyperparameters of these models equal to 1.  Specifically, 

$$
\alpha_c = \beta_c = \alpha_i = \beta_i = 1
$$.  


 (Another possible idea here is to use empircal Bayes where these priors are based on league average completion and interception rates.)


\subsection{Model for yardage given completion}
Let $y_i$ be the yards gained on the $i$-th completed pass, $y_i^{\star} = log(y_i +1)$, and $TD_{i}$ is an indicator equal to 1 if the $i$-th completion is a touchdown and 0 otherwise.  Since we are trying to model yards given a completed pass, we consider touchdowns to be censoring events.  That is, if a player throws a 10 yard touchdown pass, we know that the play we at least ten yards.  This leads to the following likelihood function for modeling yards: 
$$
L(\mu, \sigma^2 | {\bf y}^{\star}) \propto \prod_{i=1}^n f(y_i^{\star}|\mu, \sigma^2)^{1-TD_i} S(y_i^{\star}|\mu, \sigma^2)^{TD_i}
$$
where $f$ is the pdf of a normal distribution and $S$ is the survival function of a normal distribution both with parameters $\mu$ and $\sigma^2$.  

For priors on $\mu$ amd $\sigma^2$, we use: 

$$
\mu \sim Normal(0,10^{6})
$$

$$
\sigma^2 \sim Uniform(0,100)
$$.  











\subsection{Data - Open Source}
\section{Data}
We are using play-by-play data from nflscrapr [MORE DETAILS]

In this pursuit of an understandable and intuitive passer ranking system, it makes sense to use the simplest statistics which surround a quarterback's time on the field. Further, as this strives to remain an open source project, the variables pulled in must remain easily accessible and, likewise, public. For this reason, the data pulled in for each quarterback when all was said and done were completions, yards, interceptions and touchdowns, for each time they were snapped the ball and opted to throw. 

A pleasant duality of this data decision lies within how closely it mirrors the NFL's passer rating formula described above. In so much as this newly improved metric looks to build upon and redefine the NFL's method, it is not an attempt at reinventing the wheel. 
  
    \subsubsection{nflscrapr}

The data used and simulated upon within RIPPEN is scraped from and publically available in another open-source R package, \href{https://github.com/maksimhorowitz/nflscrapR}{\textit{nflscrapr}}. This project pulls, parses, and groups data from the NFL API for easy use. Although many of the added capabilities were not used for this paper, the building block data for our simulations was. Before diving into talk of simulations, the variables gathered should be ironed out and explained. Below is an example of 4 successive rows in our table, from a game between the Steelers and the Colts, one which had "Big Ben" throwing quite well until an interception gave Collins a chance to toss around the old pigskin.

This table houses the name of the quartback, binary variables for whether the pass was complete or imcomplete, intercepted or not, fumbled or not, and an integer value of yards obtained on the play. An interesting subdivision which \textit{nflscrapr} has to offer is the breakdown of TotalYards into "air yards" and "yards after reception". Although future versions of RIPPEN might factor in these variables separately, it was deemed wisest to aggregate them for TotalYards as a good quarterback can be recognized by his ability to pick a receiver in the most advantageous receiving position.



%Let's do this table with knitr so we know where it came from.
<<xtable, results="asis", echo = FALSE>>= 
library(xtable)
nfl <- read.csv(file = "/Users/gregorymatthews/Dropbox/RIPPENgit/data/total09-18_pbp_data.csv")
nfl <- subset(nfl, passer_player_name == "M.Trubisky")
tab <- xtable(nfl[1:4,c("passer_player_name","complete_pass","interception","fumble","air_yards","yards_after_catch")])
print(tab,include.rownames=FALSE)
@
% \begin{center}
% \begin{tabular}{ |c|c|c|c|c|c|  }
%  \hline
%  \multicolumn{5}{|c|}{Sample Data} \\
%  \hline
% Passer & PassOutcome & InterceptionThrown & Fumble & TotalYards\\
%  \hline
% B.Roethlisberger & 1 & 0 & 0 & 5\\
%   \hline
% B.Roethlisberger & 1 & 0 & 0 & 30\\
%   \hline
% B.Roethlisberger & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0\\
%   \hline
% K.Collins & 1 & 0 & 0 & 4 \\
% 
%   \hline
%  \end{tabular}
%  \end{center}

Additionally, solely tracking air yards would hurt the rating of quarterbacks who are effective in deploying a short pitch play to a receiver now open to run 20 yards. Altogether, as RIPPEN looks to capture the effect the throwing quarterback had on the team's state at that moment in the game, these are the variables chosen, simple as they may be. 

\subsection{How we use our data}
  
  Taking this data, broken down by player over seasons we looked to implement a sampling notion, allowing us to build upon our finite examples and imagine a world in which each team put their quarterbacks on the field to throw their hearts out. The only downside to generating this data is that we lose context. Therefore, we needed to structure a proxy measure of whether or not a scoring drive (now just a series of yards gained or imcomplete/intercepted passes) led to a touchdown or a favorable position on the field for a fieldgoal. As such, we need to try to crunch and fit a simulated array of data into a football framework; imposing conditions on successive substrings which, on the field, translate to a continued drive. \\
  
  Looking at our aforementioned data example, let's try to picture what the game looked like assuming there were no rushing plays betwixt our rows. The game starts, more or less on the Steelers' twenty yard line with Roethlisberger's first play resulting in a five yard gain. Therefore, we are at "second and five", with the drive continuing on. Were they not to make ten yards within this "down series", successive first, second, third, and fourth downs, then the drive is over, either resulting in a punt or a field goal attempt. As Ben's next throw is a moderate bomb of thirty yards he does not need to worry about a third down just yet, as the Steelers are back to first down in a brand new down series for the same drive. Great! So now the Steelers are over half-field and looking to put some points on the board, until Ben goes and throws an interception. Regardless of where the current drive and down series state, an interception is an automatic end to the drive, resulting in a returned value of zero points for the quarterback and the team. Hopefully, even if football is a foreign sport to you, this colorful description helped you identify a few criterion a passed array of play results must meet for a drive to stay alive and to identify the drive's down series at any step along the way. 
  
  
    \subsubsection{Simulation! Bayseian?}
    
    With this ability to map decontextualized data into a football framework, RIPPEN is capable of utilizing simulated data; deepening the pool of observations upon which to gauge a quarterback's efficacy. To generate these sampled observations, \textbf{PLEASE SAVE ME}. 
    
    \subsubsection{Markov Chain Notion:}
    
    Formalizing our mapping from raw data into a drive and down series framework requires us to apply some notion of ordering and series-dependency into our array. A prominent way of reworking this into a generalized probability, is through Markov Chains. This matrix allows you to map out the probabilities of moving from one state to another, probabilities which will sum to one as everyone leaving a state must be on their way to another one. After you finish simmering over that metaphysical tidbit, you may recognize that the states are fully contained to any generic down series, with the states randing from first to fourth down. As a drive is mortal and can end with either a failed fouth-down attempt or an interception, we also need to include an absorbing state for a dead drive. For clean rendering, any non-zero or one values are encapsulated in variables which will be described beneath:
\begin{center}
	\begin{tabular}{|c |c c c c c|} 
		\hline
		-Markov- & Down 1 & Down 2 & Down 3 & Down 4 & Over\\ \hline
		Down 1 & a & b & 0 & 0 & c \\ 
		\hline
		Down 2 & d & 0 & e & 0 & f \\
		\hline
		Down 3 & g & 0 & 0 & h & i\\
		\hline
		Down 4 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & j\\
		\hline
		Over & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1\\
		\hline
	\end{tabular}
	\begin{align*}
	a &= Pr(y_{d,1} > 10)\\
	b &= 1-a\\
	c &= Pr(y_{d,2} > 10 - y_{d,1})\\
	d &= 1 - c\\
	e &= Pr(y_{d,3} > 10 - y_{d,2} - y_{d,1})\\
	f &= 1 - e\\
	g &= \\
	h &= \textbf{Will fill these out in a minute}\\
	i &= \\
	j &= \\
	\end{align*}
\end{center}
  \textbf{Might try to stagger these out by row, making them two or three wide.}\\
  To make sense of the variables above, we need to iron out some notation. As commonly used, \textit{Pr()} stands for the probability that the given value will occur. This makes sense as Markov Chains are our way of generalizing probabilities within any given state. More \textbf{arcane(@luc.edu)} is our notation for the drive state and down: $Pr(y_{d,n} > w)$. This notation captures the probability that the number of yards yielded from down series $d$ and down $n$ will be greater than $w$ yards. As this $y_{d,n}$ notation pervades, we should pin down constraints on $d$ and $n$. As our simulations start the drive on the offensive team's twenty yard line and it takes at least ten yards for a new down series to begin within a drive, $d$ is always an integer ranging from 1 to 8, while the nested $n$ is always contained to the set \{1,2,3,4\}. We also need to account for the ever-present possibility of an interception, an event contained within the $I$ indicator function. 
    \subsubsection{Variable description! (More i's than Mississippi)}

  Dedicated to the variables noted in Markov Chain -- make sense of each one and explain significance.
  
  \begin{enumerate}
  
  \item G: The result of the drive/simulation. Either 7 for TD, 3 for FG or 0 for interception or missed FG. \\
  
  \item I(...): Indicator function: ... \\
  
  \item $C_{d,i}$ ... \\
  
  \item $I_{d,i}$: E[ I(D = 4) ] = P(D = 4) \\
  
  \item $C_{d,i}$: $t'_{1} \cdot M$ = $t'_{2}$ = [$a$  $b$  0  0] \\
  
  \item .... : $t'_{2} \cdot M$ = $t'_{3}$ = [$a^{2}+bc$  $ab$  $bd$  0] \\
  
  \item $$Pr(G_{j} = 3) = Pr(FG \cap (\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} I(D_{n} = 4) = 0 ) \cap (\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} y_{i} < 80 | Q = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} y_{i})) \cdot P(Q = q)$$ \\ ... Pr(FG $\cap$ Q = q) \\ 
 
  \item $$Pr(G=7) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} Pr(\sum_{i = 1}^{n}y_{i} > 80 | \sum_{i=1}^{n}I(D_{i} = 4) = 0) \cdot P(...)$$

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{How we visualize, parse our analyses?}

Idk, Look at other sections of this paper and prep for that. Suppose we could at least speak to breaking it down by season, game, player and whatnot.

\subsection{Theoretical Results}
Do we have any? I guess, in theory, we do?

\subsection{Correlation between RIPPEN and winning}
Compare RIPPEN and winning to QBR and winning.  

\subsection{Preliminary Results \& Notes}

\subsection{Bayesian Posterior Distributions Stuff}
What do the posterior parameters look like? 

\subsection{Rodgers vs Tebow Example. }

\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
RIPPEN is good.  We will do more eventually.  

Adding a defensive adjustment.  


Do we even want to add these things?  
How do we deal with pass interference?  
Defensive Holding? 
Sacks? Add another layer.  
Fumbles? Could treat similar to interceptions? 
Should interceptions ever result in negative numbers?  
How do we assign the negative numbers for interceptions?
